# Nowar Sans (有爱黑体 / 有愛黑體)

This is Nowar Sans, a fully-hinted Chinese font family based on Noto Sans, Roboto and Source Han Sans, optimised for _World of Warcraft_.

> Make Love, Not Warcraft.<br>
> 要有爱，不要魔兽争霸。<br>
> 要愛，不要魔獸。

The unhinted version of Nowar Sans, is originally made for customized _World of Warcraft_ font packs, `WoW 有爱黑体` and `WoW 有愛黑體`. And that’s why it is named after “Nowar” (“有爱” / “有愛”).

## Guide for Getting Nowar Sans

Nowar Sans font files can be found at [Releases](https://github.com/CyanoHao/Nowar-Sans/releases).

“Nowar Sans _version_” are general purpose fonts, provided in `ttf` and `ttc` format.
- `NowarSansTTC-<version>.7z` contains all `ttc` files. These `ttc` files contain too much fonts, which are not available in legacy Windows. If they’re not available, try `ttf` files instead.
- `NowarSansTTF-<version>.7z` contains all `ttf` files. `ttf` files are more compatible (even available in Windows 98) but **really huge** (~ 12.7 GiB).

“WoW Font Pack _version_ (Humanist/Neo-Grotesque)” are _World of Warcraft_ WoW font pack.
- “Humanist” and “Neo-Grotesque” are different in Latin, Greek and Cyrillic family (see “What are the names?” below).
- See “What Are the Names? → Premade WoW Font Packs” for more information about font styles.

To apply WoW font pack, download the one you like, then extract it and move `Fonts` to `World of Warcraft/`.

## Font Weight

There are 6 weights.

| Weight     | CJK Ideographs and Kana | Hint      |
| ---------- | ----------------------- | --------- |
| ExtraLight | ExtraLight              | Fair      |
| Light      | Light                   | Good      |
| Regular    | Regular                 | Excellent |
| Medium     | Medium                  | Fair      |
| Bold       | Bold                    | Good      |
| ExtraBold  | Heavy                   | Fair      |

### Why Are Latin, Greek and Cyrillic Characters “Semi-Condensed”?

If not, numbers may be displayed incompletely in WoW 简体中文 and 繁體中文, such as character level in legacy guild frame, and numbers of reagents in profession crafting frame.

## To Build

**WARNING**: 140 GiB free disk space required. When running with `-j8`, it requires up to 24 GiB free memory, and takes about 24 hours.

You need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) 8.5 (or newer), [otfcc](https://github.com/caryll/otfcc), [AFDKO](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko.html) and [ttfautohint](https://www.freetype.org/ttfautohint) installed, then run:

```bash
npm install
```

after the NPM packages are installed, run

```bash
node build ttf
```

to build the TTF files, it would be in `build/out` directory.

To build TTC, type

```bash
node build ttc
```

instead, the files would be in `build/ttc` directory.

### Boost Building Process

Since [Nowar Sans 0.3.9](https://github.com/CyanoHao/Nowar-Sans/releases/tag/v0.3.9), ideohint cache files are also provided. With existing cache files, building time will be reduced by up to 60%.

To make use of cache file, just download `nowar-ideohint-cache-<version>.7z`, then extract it and move `hint-_sg{1,2,3,4,5,6}.hgc` to `Nowar-Sans/hint/build/` before building.

### I Need an Unhinted Version

It is possible but really difficult to edit the script to generate an unhinted version of the fonts.

It is recommanded to remove hint from generated `ttf` files:

```bash
for file in *.ttf ; do
    otfccdump --ignore-hints --pretty $file | sed 's/; ttfautohint (v*.*)//' | otfccbuild -o $file -O3
done
```

`sed` changes the version string, and `--pretty` decreases memory consumption by `sed`.

By the way, if you just want to build an unhinted font for WoW font pack (or any other purpose), merging with [FontForge](https://fontforge.github.io/) is a good choise.
